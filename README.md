# Hi, Iâ€™m Matteo

I am a developer with a background in international marketing, marketing automation, and a growing focus on data science and machine learning.

I have completed full stack web development and machine learning bootcamps. I enjoy building data-driven tools and applications that solve real-world problems, especially in the food industry.

My main interest is applying web development, analytics, and machine learning to the food retail sector to support smarter marketing decisions through data.

## Key Skills

- Full stack development with React, Node.js, and SQL  
- Python for data science including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLP, and neural networks  
- Data visualization and API integration  
- Marketing automation and digital strategy  

In the past, I created and scaled a food brand that reached over three million followers. That experience sparked my interest in using technology to drive growth and strategy in the food industry.

I am based in Spain and speak Italian, English, Spanish, and German. In my free time, I enjoy fitness and cooking healthy high-protein recipes.
